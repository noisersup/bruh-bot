# bruh bot
Simple Discord bot that answers to any **"bruh"** he sees</br></br>

## Getting Started
You can compile and host it by yourself or use this link:
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=689547353719308369&permissions=3214336&scope=bot </br>
For now it doesn't have any constant hosting (It's just a prototype), so it can be turned off sometimes but in the near future will be hosted on something serious.

## TO-DO
* :heavy_check_mark: Basic answering **"bruh"** on chat
* :heavy_check_mark: Ignore spaces between letters (Now you can type **b r u h**)
* Config file to store data like token
* Answering on voice chat
* Find a hosting
* Add a counter of **bruh moments** on server

**bruh...**
