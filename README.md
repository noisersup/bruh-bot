# bruh bot
Simple Discord bot that answers to any **"bruh"** he sees</br></br>

## Getting Started
You can compile and host it by yourself or use this link:
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=689547353719308369&permissions=3214336&scope=bot </br>
For now it doesn't have any constant hosting (It's just a prototype), so it can be turned off sometimes but in the near future will be hosted on something serious.
